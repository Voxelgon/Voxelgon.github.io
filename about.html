Voxelgon is being written in C# in the Unity3D game engine for Mac, Windows, and Linux by Andrew Cassidy, high school student in California. The game has graphics reminicent of early 3D space sim games, mixed with higher end real-time shadows and other current-gen features. It borrows heavily from both space sim games and real time strategy games, as well as rogue likes. The game's art style is inspired by classic science fiction, like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Alien.
