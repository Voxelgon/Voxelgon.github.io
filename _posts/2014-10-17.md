title: Why I Might Switch to the Unreal Engine
---

I recently aquired my github student account, wich includes, amoung other awesome products, a copy of the Unreal Engine 4. I looked at using the Unreal Engine before in the past, back when it was still Windows-only, and didn't realize there was now a mac (and Linux!) version of the editor and compiler. 

Well, I've had some qualms about Unity3D, mostly with the .NET framework. C# is just not the kind of language I enjoy using, and Unity doesn't really make it any better. A lot of the things I want to do require wild cheats and workarounds around the FPS-first Platformer-first nature of the engine. The engine doesn't allow for the deeper level of customization I need for Voxelgon. Luckily, I'll be able to use the same models and textures as in Unity, and I unfortunately have to rework a lot of the code anyways. 

So far C++ appears to be a good language, but will require some learning to use. I've done things in Arduino before, but nothing on this kind of scale. The engine also recomends using XCode, which, with a simple Vim extension and Monokai theme and it appears to be quite nice.
